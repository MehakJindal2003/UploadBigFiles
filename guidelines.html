		    <h1><u>Guidelines and Policies</u></h1>
            <p>If there's one thing we truly love, it's sharing in all the great foodie moments you have. Bouquets when the food exceeds your expectations, brickbats when the service is shocking, chronicles of your food excursions â€“ they all count.</p>

            <p>While we welcome your opinions and descriptions of your dining experiences, there are a few things we expect from every user on Foodies<b style="color:red;">S</b>pot. Your reviews and photos, as well as your profile and the comments you share, are all subject to Content Guidelines, our Foodie Code of Conduct.</p>
			<br><br><br>
		    <h2>Foodie Code of Conduct</h2>
            <h3>Keep out the clutter</h3>
            <p>To make sure we collectively work towards building the highest-quality content that's useful to everyone, reviews need to be a minimum of 140 characters long for dine-in reviews.. That's just about the length of a tweet, so it's convenient even for all you micro-bloggers. If you cover the food, service and ambiance, you shouldn't fall short on characters. We do not have 140 characters limit for an online order review. However, if any review is filled with junk, we might have to remove the review altogether.</p>
            <h3>Keep it clean</h3>
            <p>Whether you're writing a small snippet or a delightfully detailed account of your meal, keep foul/abusive/hateful language, threats, and lewdness out of it. We, just like you, hate junk and will delete it whenever we see it. This also includes (but is not limited to) derogatory comments on someone's protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender, religion) or indication of a personal vendetta against a business and its associates.</p>
			<h3>Keep it fresh</h3>
            <p>Only one review per restaurant for a dine out experience and one review for each online order transaction can be submitted and your most recent experience at a place counts. That's what is going to help people when they're trying to decide whether or not to eat there. You're free to edit and update your review based on subsequent visits at any time. Reviews about old experiences (more than 6 months old) will also be deleted from our platform.</p>
			<h3>Don't steal</h3>
            <p>Plagiarism is something we take seriously. Copying others' reviews or photos from Foodies<b style="color:red;">S</b>pot or other platforms, or even re-posting your own in multiple places on Foodies<b style="color:red;">S</b>pot (in full or in part), is something that will not be tolerated and may be removed/ moderated.. We trust that you'll play fair and create your own content.</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<h2>Photo guidelines</h2>
            <p>There's no easier way to show how deliciously chocolate-y that chocolate mud cake was than with a picture, right? That said, it's important to keep in mind our photo guidelines, and understand why some photos may be moved or removed once they've been added.</p>

            <p>Food shots that are clear, in focus, and delicious enough to make the viewer wish Foodies<b style="color:red;">S</b>pot included smell-o-vision will be featured in restaurants' photo galleries. Ambiance shots that highlight the overall feel or vibe of a place will also be highlighted on restaurant pages.</p>

            <p>Photos that don't make the cut to appear on a restaurant's page, will show with your review or on your profile depending on how useful it is to other users and how relevant it is to the review. Photos with hair and bugs will be shown only with a review for validation and context.</p>

			<br><br><br>
			<h2>Guidelines for Restaurants</h2>
			<p>Foodies<b style="color:red;">S</b>pot is a great way for restaurants to reach out to a vast foodie community. A few things you should keep in mind:</p>
			<ul type="circle">
			<li><h3>Keep your listing updated</h3>: While our team makes every effort to keep information on Foodies<b style="color:red;">S</b>pot up-to-date, we appreciate you letting us know when an update is required. If your timings change and your listing is not updated, customers arriving late won't be too happy with you (or Foodies<b style="color:red;">S</b>pot).</li>
			<li><h3>Respond to criticism positively</h3>: Take two deep breaths when you get a negative review. Three, if required. This happens to all restaurants who have customers. These customers are always right, even when they are wrong. Take the unflattering reviews as constructive feedback and use it as an opportunity to fix things. Whether you agree with the feedback or not, take the criticism in good stride. You can reply with a management response to show you care, but please don't use this as a platform to hit back or offer the customer an incentive to edit their review. Your response can't be edited after posting, so choose your words well.</li>
			<li><h3>Don't solicit reviews</h3>: The best way to get reviews is to delight customers with your food and service. Selective solicitation is a strict NO, and offering any type of compensation or kick-back for reviews is unfair, so you definitely want to keep away from that, too.</p>
